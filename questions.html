                                <p>Start by cataloguing all existing documentation, identifying what's current,
                                    outdated, duplicated, or missing. Use analytics and user feedback to prioritise

                                    accessibility. Consider cloud-based knowledge bases (SharePoint, Confluence,

                            usable, discoverable, and maintainable knowledge resource that supports DofE's mission of
                            modernising digital platforms like eDofE.</p>

                                    support or pair struggling learners with peers. Create additional practice exercises
                                    and provide follow-up resources. Verify understanding through practical application
                                    rather than just verbal confirmation.</p>
