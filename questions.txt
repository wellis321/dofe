Have we looked at the questions with a view of providing context-action-outcome structure, with detailed examples and talking points? Is this similar to the STAR approach where you frame your answers with the situation, tas, Action and reslt? If it is then I can understand how to frame the answers well but if not how should the ansers be framed for this other approach?
