Ive delivered training to tens of thousands of people across the uk over the past twenty years. This includes in schools, colleges, Universities to both learners ad teachers/tutors. At hospitals, Social Work, Local and Natoional Government. I've delivered training that Organisations have created and then invited me to deliver and I've also created my oewn courses that I've then went onto deliver such as The first Traning for Trainers course in Mental Health Peer Support. I've worked with some organisaions over many years in developing courses and working with the people on them such as the West of Scotland Social Work Mental Health Officer Honours Degree which I worked on delivering for many years as a trainer and also improving. I was part of the team that developed the National trainnig curriculum for nurses - The Ten Essential Shared capabilities  and also Realising Recovery which I also helped deliver nationaly.
I've created many blended learning courses for organisation s and local government bodies including technical based courses such as understannding new concepts and change to simple "how tos". I've also built software designed to deliver documentation in accessable formats using the most upto date web standards avai;able which I've now moved across to my policy management system and the organisation playbook both of which can be linked to in the footer.
