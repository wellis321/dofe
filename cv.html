                        The Organisation Playbook is a guide I'm creating to structuring an organisation around people and their
                        needs, rather than rigid systems. It aims to create intuitive, efficient workflows where staff do not require
                        extensive training to navigate digital systems. Instead, information and processes are designed to be
                        natural and accessible.

                        I've created this resource to standardise organisational policy creation. Using this tool policies can have
                        strict version control with access limited to role permissions reflecting the organisational requirements.
                        Policies are easy to read and follow modern A11y principles and guidelines. They are easy to create, edit
                        and manage and integrate fully with the rest of the organisational digital architecture.

                    <h3>The Scotland Equality Group</h3>
                    <p><strong>01/1999 - Present</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        A group I founded to highlight the negative impact on all of us as a result of Income Inequality. It provided
                        evidence on each of eleven different health and social problems: physical health, mental health, drug
                        abuse, education, imprisonment, obesity, social mobility, trust and community life, violence, teenage
                        births, and child well-being. For all eleven of these health and social problems, outcomes are very
                        substantially worse in more unequal societies.
