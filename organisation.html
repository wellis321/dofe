                    The DofE has empowered young people since 1956 and now operates in over 130 countries. Their vision
                    of
                    “Youth Without Limits” guides inclusive programmes in Volunteering, Physical, Skills, and
                    Expedition.
                    They
                    support licensed partners—from schools to youth groups to hospitals—while prioritising safeguarding,
                    accessibility, and an impactful expansion strategy.

                <h2>The Duke of Edinburgh Title</h2>
                <p>
                    The award is named after <strong>Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</strong> (1921–2021), who founded
                    the
                    programme in 1956. Prince Philip held the title from 1947 (when he married Princess Elizabeth, later
                    Queen Elizabeth II) until his death in 2021. His vision was to help young people develop skills,
                    confidence, and resilience through structured challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The current <strong>Duke of Edinburgh is Prince Edward</strong> (the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth
                    II
                    and Prince Philip). King Charles III conferred the title upon him in March 2023. Prince Edward and
                    his
                    wife Sophie (now Duchess of Edinburgh) are active supporters of the DofE charity and its programmes,
                    continuing the royal family's commitment to youth development.

                <h2>How the Award Started</h2>
                <p>
                    Prince Philip founded the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in 1956 in collaboration with two key figures:
                    <strong>Kurt Hahn</strong>, a German educationalist, and <strong>Lord Hunt</strong> (John Hunt),
                    leader
                    of
                    the first successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The programme was inspired by Hahn's <strong>'Moray Badge' scheme</strong>, which Prince Philip had
                    participated in during his time at Gordonstoun School in Scotland. Hahn had developed the Moray
                    Badge in
                    1936 as a way to encourage personal development through structured activities.
                </p>
                <div class="list">
                    <strong>The first programme structure (1956):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rescue and Public Service Training</strong> — serving communities</li>
                        <li><strong>The Expedition</strong> — adventure and outdoor challenges</li>
                        <li><strong>Pursuits and Projects</strong> — developing skills and interests</li>
                        <li><strong>Fitness</strong> — physical wellbeing and activity</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The initial aim was to support young men aged 15 to 18 during the transitional period between
                    leaving
                    school at 15 and entering National Service at 18. The programme sought to build self-confidence and
                    a
                    sense of purpose through voluntary self-development activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>First year success:</strong> The programme was administered by John Hunt and initially
                    involved
                    national voluntary youth organisations, Local Education Authorities, the Armed Forces, and select
                    independent and grammar schools. In its inaugural year, approximately <strong>7,000 boys
                        enrolled</strong>
                    and <strong>1,000 Awards were achieved</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The programme expanded to include girls in 1958, and by 1969, the separate programmes were
                    amalgamated
                    into a single framework. The age range was later extended to 25 in 1980. Today, the DofE operates in
                    over
                    140 countries and has transformed millions of young lives.
                </p>
                <p class="note">
                    This origin story shows the DofE's commitment to structured, accessible personal development—values
                    that
                    align with creating clear, inclusive training and knowledge resources for staff.

                    helps match volunteers to appropriate roles and ensures that participants receive support from
                    qualified, experienced volunteers.

                    Understanding volunteer management systems and training demonstrates awareness of the operational
                    complexity of supporting 40,000+ volunteers. This is particularly relevant for the IT Knowledge
                    &amp; Content Coordinator role, as you would likely be involved in creating training materials,
                    documentation, and knowledge resources that help volunteers effectively use systems like eDofE and
                    understand their roles.
