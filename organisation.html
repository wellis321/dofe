                <h2>About The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award</h2>
                <p>
                    The DofE has empowered young people since 1956 and now operates in over 130 countries. Their vision
                    of
                    "Youth Without Limits" guides inclusive programmes in Volunteering, Physical, Skills, and
                    Expedition.
                    They
                    support licensed partners—from schools to youth groups to hospitals—while prioritising safeguarding,
                    accessibility, and an impactful expansion strategy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Who are "young people"?</strong> The DofE defines young people as participants aged
                    <strong>14 to 24</strong>. The programme is open to anyone within this age range, regardless of
                    ability, interest, or background. Participants can work towards Bronze, Silver, or Gold Awards, with
                    each level requiring completion of activities across four sections: Volunteering, Physical, Skills,
                    and Expedition (plus a Residential section for Gold).
                </p>

                <h2>Bronze, Silver & Gold Awards</h2>
                <p>
                    The DofE offers three progressive levels of achievement: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Each level
                    represents increasing commitment, challenge, and personal development. These awards are highly
                    regarded by employers, universities, and educational institutions as they demonstrate qualities such
                    as commitment, leadership, teamwork, resilience, and perseverance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>What do the Awards mean?</strong> Achieving a DofE Award signifies that a young person has
                    dedicated significant time and effort to personal development across multiple areas. The Awards are
                    recognised internationally and provide a structured framework for young people to challenge
                    themselves, set personal goals, and achieve them, thereby preparing them for future personal and
                    professional endeavours.

                    <strong>Recognition and value:</strong> DofE Awards are recognised by employers, universities, and
                    educational institutions worldwide. They demonstrate that a young person has developed key life
                    skills including commitment, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, and perseverance. Many
                    universities and employers value DofE Awards as evidence of well-rounded personal development and
                    the ability to balance multiple commitments over an extended period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gold Award holders are particularly recognised, with the Gold Award ceremony often attended by
                    members of the Royal Family, and the achievement being noted on UCAS applications and CVs. The
                    Awards provide young people with tangible evidence of their personal development journey and the
                    skills they've developed along the way.

                <h2>The Duke of Edinburgh Title</h2>
                <p>
                    The award is named after <strong>Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</strong> (1921–2021), who founded
                    the
                    programme in 1956. Prince Philip held the title from 1947 (when he married Princess Elizabeth, later
                    Queen Elizabeth II) until his death in 2021. His vision was to help young people develop skills,
                    confidence, and resilience through structured challenges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The current <strong>Duke of Edinburgh is Prince Edward</strong> (the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth
                    II
                    and Prince Philip). King Charles III conferred the title upon him in March 2023. Prince Edward and
                    his
                    wife Sophie (now Duchess of Edinburgh) are active supporters of the DofE charity and its programmes,
                    continuing the royal family's commitment to youth development.

                <h2>How the Award Started</h2>
                <p>
                    Prince Philip founded the Duke of Edinburgh's Award in 1956 in collaboration with two key figures:
                    <strong>Kurt Hahn</strong>, a German educationalist, and <strong>Lord Hunt</strong> (John Hunt),
                    leader
                    of
                    the first successful ascent of Mount Everest in 1953.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The programme was inspired by Hahn's <strong>'Moray Badge' scheme</strong>, which Prince Philip had
                    participated in during his time at Gordonstoun School in Scotland. Hahn had developed the Moray
                    Badge in
                    1936 as a way to encourage personal development through structured activities.
                </p>
                <div class="list">
                    <strong>The first programme structure (1956):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Rescue and Public Service Training</strong> — serving communities</li>
                        <li><strong>The Expedition</strong> — adventure and outdoor challenges</li>
                        <li><strong>Pursuits and Projects</strong> — developing skills and interests</li>
                        <li><strong>Fitness</strong> — physical wellbeing and activity</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The initial aim was to support young men aged 15 to 18 during the transitional period between
                    leaving
                    school at 15 and entering National Service at 18. The programme sought to build self-confidence and
                    a
                    sense of purpose through voluntary self-development activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>First year success:</strong> The programme was administered by John Hunt and initially
                    involved
                    national voluntary youth organisations, Local Education Authorities, the Armed Forces, and select
                    independent and grammar schools. In its inaugural year, approximately <strong>7,000 boys
                        enrolled</strong>
                    and <strong>1,000 Awards were achieved</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The programme expanded to include girls in 1958, and by 1969, the separate programmes were
                    amalgamated
                    into a single framework. The age range was later extended to 25 in 1980. Today, the DofE operates in
                    over
                    140 countries and has transformed millions of young lives.
                </p>
                <p class="note">
                    I see this origin story as showing the DofE's commitment to structured, accessible personal
                    development—values that align with creating clear, inclusive training and knowledge resources for
                    staff.

                        <h4>Advocacy</h4>
                        <p>Youth Ambassadors join advocacy efforts as a charity and become the voice of their
                            generation.
                            This is a fantastic opportunity to express views to policymakers, ensuring the perspectives
                            of young people are considered when it comes to decisions which impact their future. They
                            have been involved in political party conferences and delivered letters to Downing Street
                            calling on government to back youth initiatives.</p>

                        <h4>Content Creation</h4>
                        <p>Youth Ambassadors regularly feature on DofE's social media channels and website. From writing
                            blogs to co-creating videos, content creation is a key part of the role. In the past Youth
                            Ambassadors have raised awareness of the Skills section of the Award by filming videos for
                            World Youth Skills Day and have been spotlighted in the DofE's "People like YOUth" film
                            series.</p>
