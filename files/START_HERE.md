### OPTIONAL (Nice to Have):
🔹 **Short video tutorial** (3-4 minutes) showing the login process - this demonstrates async learning material creation
🔹 **Simple quiz** (5 questions) to show assessment creation skills
🔹 **Moodle mini-course** - only if you have time, this directly shows LMS skills

### DON'T Overcomplicate:
❌ Don't create elaborate graphics if simple screenshots work

❌ Don't build a full LMS course unless you really want to
❌ Don't spend hours on video editing - simple screen recording is fine

## 🧠 Should You Create a Mini Course?

**Short answer:** Yes, but keep it simple.

**Best approach:**
1. **Enhanced web page** (2-3 hours) ← **RECOMMENDED**
   - Add new page to your existing site
   - Embed your training video
   - Add downloadable Quick Reference
   - Include FAQ section
   - Add simple 5-question quiz
   - Link to official Instagram help

2. **Optional Moodle demo** (4-5 hours) ← Only if you have time
   - Shows your LMS expertise directly
   - Create 3-section mini course
   - Include video, quiz, resources
   - Mention you could expand to full course

**Why the web page is better:**
- Faster to create
- Still professional
- Shows web development skills
- Accessible to everyone (no LMS login needed)
- You already have the infrastructure

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't spend weeks building elaborate course
- Don't overcomplicate
- Simple and professional beats complex and rushed
