Important Safety Tips
🔒 NEVER share your password with anyone - not even family or friends
🔒 Make your password strong: use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
🔒 Always log out when using a shared computer or device
🔒 Be suspicious of emails asking for your Instagram password - Instagram will never ask for it by email
🔒 If something feels wrong, it probably is - trust your instincts
