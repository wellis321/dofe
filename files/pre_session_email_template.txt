SUBJECT: Your Instagram Training Session - Wednesday 3rd December, 9:00 AM

---

Dear [Interviewer Name / DofE Interview Panel],

I'm looking forward to delivering the training session on **"Logging into Instagram for Complete Beginners"** this Wednesday, 3rd December at 9:00 AM GMT via Microsoft Teams.

**What to Expect:**

In this 10-minute session, I'll guide you through:
- What Instagram is and why logging in is important
- A step-by-step demonstration of the login process
- Common problems people face and how to solve them
- Essential security tips for safe social media use

The session is designed for someone who has never used social media before, so I'll be using clear, jargon-free language throughout.

**Attached Resources:**

I've prepared a Quick Reference Guide (PDF) that you can use during and after the session. This includes:
- Visual step-by-step instructions
- Solutions to common problems
- Safety tips
- Support contacts

Feel free to review this in advance if you'd like, though it's not required.

**Optional - Follow Along:**

If you'd like to follow along practically during the session, you're welcome to have a device ready (phone, tablet, or computer). However, this is completely optional - the session will be just as valuable if you simply watch the demonstration.

**Accessibility:**

I'm committed to making this training accessible to everyone. If you need any specific adjustments to make the session work better for you (such as larger text, different color schemes, slower pace, or any other accommodation), please let me know and I'll be happy to arrange this.

**Questions Before the Session?**

If you have any questions before Wednesday, please feel free to reach out to me at williamjamesellis@outlook.com.

**Additional Resources:**

I've also created a web-based resource page with supplementary materials, which you can access here: https://wellis321.github.io/dofe/second-interview.html

I'm really excited about this opportunity to demonstrate how I approach digital skills training, and I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday!

Best regards,
