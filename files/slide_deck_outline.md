## SLIDE 1: TITLE SLIDE

**Visual Elements:**
- Title: "Logging into Instagram"
- Subtitle: "A Beginner's Guide to Getting Started with Social Media"
- Your name: William Ellis
- Date: 3rd December 2025
- Instagram logo (colorful gradient camera icon)
- Clean, professional design with DofE brand colors if available

**Speaker Notes:**
"Good morning, and thank you for this opportunity! Today I'm going to show you how to log into Instagram - a social media platform where people share photos and connect with others. Even if you've never used social media before, by the end of these 10 minutes, you'll understand exactly how to access Instagram safely and confidently. Let's get started!"

**Timing:** 30 seconds

## SLIDE 2: WHAT IS INSTAGRAM?

**Visual Elements:**
- Large Instagram logo at top
- 3 simple icons with text:
  📸 "Share Photos & Videos"
  👥 "Connect with Friends"
  🌍 "Discover New Content"
- Simple, colorful illustrations

**Speaker Notes:**
"So, what is Instagram? Think of it as a digital photo album that you share with friends and family. People use Instagram to post pictures, watch videos, and keep in touch with people they care about. It's like a noticeboard where everyone can share what they're up to. Instagram is used by millions of people around the world - from your grandchildren showing off their latest adventure, to businesses sharing their products, to celebrities connecting with fans."

**Timing:** 45 seconds

## SLIDE 3: WHY DO YOU NEED TO LOG IN?

**Visual Elements:**
- Icon of a key or padlock 🔐
- Simple diagram showing:
  "Your Account" → "Login" → "Access Your Photos & Friends"
- Bullet points:
  • Proves it's really you
  • Keeps your account safe
  • Access your personal content

**Speaker Notes:**
"Before you can use Instagram, you need to 'log in.' But what does that mean? Logging in is like unlocking a door - it proves to Instagram that you're really you, and not someone else trying to access your account. You need an Instagram account first - think of it like having a library card. Once you have an account, logging in is how you access it each time. This keeps your photos, messages, and connections private and secure. You only need to log in once on each device, and Instagram will usually remember you after that."

**Timing:** 1 minute

## SLIDE 4: WHERE TO FIND INSTAGRAM

**Visual Elements:**
- Split screen design:
  
**Left side - "On a Phone or Tablet":**
- Screenshot of App Store with Instagram in search
- Arrow pointing to Instagram app icon
- Text: "Search 'Instagram' in your app store"

**Right side - "On a Computer":**
- Screenshot of web browser with instagram.com
- Arrow pointing to URL bar
- Text: "Visit www.instagram.com"

- Note at bottom: "Look for the official Instagram logo ✓"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let me show you how to find Instagram. If you're using a phone or tablet, you'll need to download the Instagram app first. Open your app store - that's the 'App Store' on an iPhone or iPad, or 'Play Store' on an Android device. Type 'Instagram' in the search bar, and you'll see the Instagram app with its colorful camera logo. Make sure it's the official one - you'll see a verified checkmark next to it. Tap to download and install it.

If you're using a computer, it's even simpler. Open your web browser - that's Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge - and type 'instagram.com' in the address bar at the top. Press Enter, and you'll be taken to Instagram's website."

**Timing:** 1 minute 30 seconds

## SLIDE 5: THE LOGIN SCREEN EXPLAINED

**Visual Elements:**
- Large, annotated screenshot of Instagram login screen
- Numbered arrows pointing to:
  1. "Username or Email" box (with example: "your_username or you@email.com")
  2. "Password" box (with dots shown: "••••••••")
  3. "Show Password" eye icon
  4. "Log In" button (blue, prominent)
  5. "Forgot Password?" link (small text below)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Now, let's look at the login screen - this is what you'll see when you open Instagram. There are two main boxes here. [Point to screen]

The first box asks for your 'Username or Email.' This is either the username you chose when you created your account, or the email address you used to sign up. Let's say your username is 'mary_smith123' - you'd type that here.

The second box is for your password. When you type your password, you'll see dots or asterisks instead of the actual letters. Don't worry - this is completely normal! Instagram does this to keep your password private, so no one looking over your shoulder can see it. 

See this little eye icon? If you click on that, it will show you what you're typing. This is really useful to make sure you've typed your password correctly.

Finally, there's the big blue 'Log In' button. Once you've filled in both boxes, you'll click this to log in."

**Timing:** 1 minute 30 seconds

## SLIDE 6: STEP-BY-STEP LOGIN DEMONSTRATION

**Visual Elements:**
- 4-step visual process flow:

**Step 1: [Icon] Type your username**
→ **Step 2: [Icon] Type your password**
→ **Step 3: [Icon] Click 'Log In'**
→ **Step 4: [Icon] ✓ You're in!**

- Each step has a simple illustration
- Use green checkmarks for completed steps
- Use arrows to show progression

**LIVE DEMONSTRATION ELEMENT:**
- Switch to screen share of actual Instagram login page
- Or show pre-recorded video

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let me walk you through this step by step. [Switch to live demo or video]

Step 1: Click on the first box and carefully type your username or email address. Let's use 'demo_user' as an example. [Type slowly and clearly]

Step 2: Click on the password box and type your password. Notice how it shows dots instead of letters? That's keeping your password secure. For this demo, I'll click the eye icon so you can see what I'm typing. [Type 'Example123!' slowly]

Step 3: Now I'll click the blue 'Log In' button. [Click button]

Step 4: Instagram is now checking your details... and there we go! We're in. You'll see your Instagram feed appear - that's your home page with photos and posts from people you follow.

It really is that simple - username, password, click Log In, and you're in!"

**Timing:** 2 minutes

## SLIDE 7: COMMON PROBLEM #1 - FORGOT PASSWORD

**Visual Elements:**
- Red "⚠️ PROBLEM" header
- Screenshot showing error message: "Sorry, your password was incorrect"
- Green "✓ SOLUTION" header
- Visual flow diagram:
  1. "Click 'Forgot Password?'"
  2. "Enter your email"
  3. "Check your email inbox"
  4. "Click the reset link"
  5. "Create a new password"
- Each step with icon and arrow

**Speaker Notes:**
"Now, let's talk about the most common problems people face, and how to solve them. The number one issue? 'I've forgotten my password!' Don't worry - this happens to everyone, and it's easy to fix.

Here's what you do: On the login screen, you'll see small text that says 'Forgot Password?' Click on that. Instagram will ask for your email address or username. Type it in and click 'Send Login Link.' 

Now, check your email inbox. You should see an email from Instagram with a link. Click on that link - it will take you to a page where you can create a brand new password. 

Choose a password you'll remember, but make it secure. A good tip is to use a phrase you'll remember, like 'BlueCats2025!' - it's got letters, numbers, and a symbol, which makes it strong. Write it down somewhere safe if you need to.

And that's it - you've reset your password and can log in with your new one!"

**Timing:** 1 minute 15 seconds

## SLIDE 8: COMMON PROBLEM #2 - INCORRECT USERNAME/PASSWORD

**Visual Elements:**
- Split design showing two common issues:

**Left side:**
"❌ 'Incorrect username or password'"
- Icon showing Caps Lock key lit up
- Checklist:
  □ Caps Lock off?
  □ Spelling correct?
  □ No extra spaces?

**Right side:**
"💡 TIP: Use the eye icon"
- Screenshot showing eye icon
- Text: "Click to see what you're typing"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Another common problem: you type in your details, click Log In, and Instagram says 'Your username or password is incorrect.' Frustrating, right? But there are a few simple things to check.

First, look at your keyboard. Is the Caps Lock key on? Passwords are case-sensitive, which means 'Password' and 'password' are considered different. If Caps Lock is on, turn it off and try again.

Second, check your spelling carefully. It's easy to accidentally add an extra letter or miss one out. 

Third, check for spaces. Sometimes we accidentally press the space bar before or after typing. There shouldn't be any spaces before or after your username or password.

Here's a great tip: click that eye icon I showed you earlier. This lets you see what you're actually typing, so you can spot any mistakes. Much easier than trying to guess!

If you've checked all of these and it's still not working, it's time to use the 'Forgot Password' option we just covered."

**Timing:** 1 minute

## SLIDE 9: COMMON PROBLEM #3 - SECURITY CODE REQUEST

**Visual Elements:**
- Screenshot showing security code entry screen
- Large "This is a GOOD thing! 🛡️" message
- Visual flow:
  📱 "Check your phone" → 📧 "Or check your email" → 🔢 "Enter the 6-digit code" → ✓ "Click Confirm"
- Example code shown: "123 456"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Sometimes, Instagram will ask you for a security code after you've entered your password. You might think 'Oh no, what's wrong?' But actually, this is a good thing! It means Instagram is protecting your account.

Instagram sends you a security code when you log in from a new device or a new location. It's Instagram's way of checking that it's really you trying to log in, and not someone else who has guessed your password.

Here's what to do: Check your phone for a text message, or check your email inbox. You'll receive a 6-digit code - it'll look something like '123 456.' Type this code carefully into Instagram, then click 'Confirm.'

That's it! You'll be logged in, and Instagram now knows this device is safe for you to use. You usually won't need to do this again on the same device.

This feature is called 'two-factor authentication,' and it's one of the best ways to keep your account secure. Some people find it a bit annoying, but it's worth it for the extra protection!"

**Timing:** 1 minute

## SLIDE 10: TOP 5 SAFETY TIPS

**Visual Elements:**
- Large heading: "Stay Safe on Instagram"
- 5 boxes, each with icon and tip:

🔒 **Tip #1:** Never share your password with anyone
🔑 **Tip #2:** Use a strong password (letters + numbers + symbols)
🚪 **Tip #3:** Always log out on shared computers
📧 **Tip #4:** Instagram never asks for passwords by email
👂 **Tip #5:** Trust your instincts - if something feels wrong, it is!

- Each tip in a different color box for visual interest
- Icons make it memorable

**Speaker Notes:**
"Before we finish, let me share five crucial safety tips. These will help keep your Instagram account secure.

Tip number one, and this is the most important: Never, ever share your password with anyone. Not your friends, not your family, not even someone claiming to be from Instagram. Your password is like the key to your house - you wouldn't give that to a stranger!

Tip two: Use a strong password. Mix up letters, numbers, and symbols. Instead of 'password123,' try something like 'BlueCats2025!' - it's much harder for someone to guess.

Tip three: If you're using a shared computer - like at a library or a friend's house - always remember to log out when you're finished. This stops the next person who uses that computer from accessing your account.

Tip four: Be very suspicious of emails asking for your Instagram password. Instagram will never, ever ask for your password by email. If you get an email like this, it's a scam - delete it immediately.

And tip five: Trust your gut. If something feels suspicious or too good to be true, it probably is. If someone you don't know is asking for personal information, don't give it to them. Stay safe out there!"
