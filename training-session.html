                    <h3>Session Structure (10-12 minutes total)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The housekeeping section ensures all participants can engage, which may add 1-2 minutes to the total time. This is essential for an effective training session.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Housekeeping & Introductions (1.5 minutes)</strong>
                            <p>Before we begin the training, I'll do a brief housekeeping section to ensure everyone is comfortable with the Teams interface and can participate effectively:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Introductions</strong> - Brief introduction of myself and the purpose of the session</li>
                                <li><strong>Who we are and why we're here</strong> - Explain the context: this is part of the interview process, demonstrating training delivery skills</li>
                                <li><strong>Teams Chat Function</strong> - Show them where the chat function is in Teams and ask them to open it</li>
                                <li><strong>Chat Monitoring</strong> - Let them know I'll be keeping an eye on the chat for any questions throughout the session, and they can do the same</li>
                                <li><strong>Raise Hand Feature</strong> - Demonstrate how to raise a hand in Teams, then ask them to practice raising their hand so I know they can use it</li>
                                <li><strong>Chat Practice</strong> - Ask them to type "Hello. It's [weather description]" in the chat (e.g., "Hello. It's rainy" or "Hello. It's sunny") so I can confirm they can use the chat function before we begin</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> This ensures all participants can engage and ask questions during the session, making the training more interactive and accessible.</p>

                        <li><strong>Introduction (1 minute)</strong>
                            <p>"Good morning! Today I'm going to show you how to log into Twitter - a social media platform where people share thoughts, news, and connect with others. Even if you've never used social media before, by the end of these 10 minutes, you'll understand exactly how to access Twitter safely and what to do if something goes wrong."</p>
                        </li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Twitter is like a digital noticeboard where people share short messages</li>
                                <li>You need an account (like having a library card)</li>
                                <li>Logging in proves it's really you accessing your account</li>
                                <li>Brief mention: available on phones, tablets, computers</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                                <li><strong>Step 2: The Login Screen</strong> - Identify the two boxes: Username/Email and Password</li>
                                <li><strong>Step 3: Entering Your Details</strong> - Demonstrate typing, explain password dots/asterisks, show the "show password" eye icon option</li>
                                <li><strong>Step 4: Clicking Log In</strong> - What happens next (loading, then your feed appears)</li>

                        </li>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Problem 1: "Forgot Password"</strong> - Where to find the link, what happens when you click it, checking email for reset link</li>
                                <li><strong>Problem 2: "Incorrect Username or Password"</strong> - Check caps lock, check spelling, try typing in a notes app first</li>
                                <li><strong>Problem 3: "Suspicious Login Attempt"</strong> - This is Twitter protecting you, how to verify it's really you (code to phone/email)</li>
                                <li><strong>Problem 4: "Account Disabled"</strong> - What this means, how to appeal/contact support</li>

                    <p><strong>Speaker Notes:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>"Good morning everyone! Before we begin, let me do a quick introduction and make sure we're all set up. I'm William Ellis, and today I'll be demonstrating a training session on logging into Twitter. This is part of the interview process for the Digital Skills Trainer and Knowledge Coordinator role at DofE."</li>
                        <li>"Now, let's make sure everyone can participate. Can you all see the chat function in Teams? [Point to chat icon] I'll have the chat open throughout the session, and I'll be keeping an eye on it for any questions you might have. Feel free to use it at any time."</li>
                        <li>"Please open the chat now if you haven't already. You should see it on the right side of your screen or at the bottom of the Teams window."</li>
                        <li>"I also want to show you the 'Raise Hand' feature. [Demonstrate] You can find it in the meeting controls - it's usually at the bottom of your screen. When you click it, I'll see a notification that you have a question. Let's practice - can everyone raise their hand now? [Wait for hands] Great! Lower your hands when you're ready."</li>

                    <p><strong>Speaker Notes:</strong> "Good morning, and thank you for this opportunity! Today I'm going to show you how to log into Twitter - a social media platform where people share thoughts, news, and connect with others. Even if you've never used social media before, by the end of these 10 minutes, you'll understand exactly how to access Twitter safely and confidently. Let's get started!"</p>

                    <p><strong>Speaker Notes:</strong> "So, what is Twitter? Think of it as a digital noticeboard where people share short messages, called 'tweets.' People use Twitter to share thoughts, read news, follow topics they're interested in, and keep in touch with people they care about. It's like a conversation happening in real-time. Twitter is used by millions of people around the world - from journalists sharing breaking news, to businesses connecting with customers, to friends sharing what they're up to."</p>

                    <p><strong>Speaker Notes:</strong> "Before you can use Twitter, you need to 'log in.' But what does that mean? Logging in is like unlocking a door - it proves to Twitter that you're really you, and not someone else trying to access your account. You need a Twitter account first - think of it like having a library card. Once you have an account, logging in is how you access it each time. This keeps your tweets, messages, and connections private and secure. You only need to log in once on each device, and Twitter will usually remember you after that."</p>

                    <p><strong>Speaker Notes:</strong> "Let me show you how to find Twitter. If you're using a phone or tablet, you'll need to download the Twitter app first. Open your app store - that's the 'App Store' on an iPhone or iPad, or 'Play Store' on an Android device. Type 'Twitter' in the search bar, and you'll see the Twitter app with its blue bird logo. Make sure it's the official one - you'll see a verified checkmark next to it. Tap to download and install it. If you're using a computer, it's even simpler. Open your web browser - that's Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge - and type 'twitter.com' or 'x.com' in the address bar at the top. Press Enter, and you'll be taken to Twitter's website."</p>

                    <p><strong>Speaker Notes:</strong> "Now, let's look at the login screen - this is what you'll see when you open Twitter. There are two main boxes here. The first box asks for your 'Username or Email.' This is either the username you chose when you created your account, or the email address you used to sign up. The second box is for your password. When you type your password, you'll see dots or asterisks instead of the actual letters. Don't worry - this is completely normal! Twitter does this to keep your password private. See this little eye icon? If you click on that, it will show you what you're typing. This is really useful to make sure you've typed your password correctly. Finally, there's the 'Log In' button. Once you've filled in both boxes, you'll click this to log in."</p>

Don't worry - this happens to everyone, and it's easy to fix. Here's what you do: On the login screen, you'll see small text that says 'Forgot Password?' Click on that. Twitter will ask for your email address or username. Type it in and click 'Send Login Link.' Now, check your email inbox. You should see an email from Twitter with a link. Click on that link - it will take you to a page where you can create a brand new password. Choose a password you'll remember, but make it secure. A good tip is to use a phrase you'll remember, like 'BlueCats2025!' - it's got letters, numbers, and a symbol, which makes it strong. Write it down somewhere safe if you need to."</p>

But there are a few simple things to check. First, look at your keyboard. Is the Caps Lock key on? Passwords are case-sensitive, which means 'Password' and 'password' are considered different. If Caps Lock is on, turn it off and try again. Second, check your spelling carefully. It's easy to accidentally add an extra letter or miss one out. Third, check for spaces. Sometimes we accidentally press the space bar before or after typing. There shouldn't be any spaces before or after your username or password. Here's a great tip: click that eye icon I showed you earlier. This lets you see what you're actually typing, so you can spot any mistakes."</p>

                    <p><strong>Speaker Notes:</strong> "Sometimes, Twitter will ask you for a security code after you've entered your password. You might think 'Oh no, what's wrong?' But actually, this is a good thing! It means Twitter is protecting your account. Twitter sends you a security code when you log in from a new device or a new location. It's Twitter's way of checking that it's really you trying to log in, and not someone else who has guessed your password. Here's what to do: Check your phone for a text message, or check your email inbox. You'll receive a 6-digit code - it'll look something like '123 456.' Type this code carefully into Twitter, then click 'Confirm.' That's it! You'll be logged in, and Twitter now knows this device is safe for you to use. You usually won't need to do this again on the same device."</p>

                    <p><strong>Speaker Notes:</strong> "Before we finish, let me share five crucial safety tips. These will help keep your Twitter account secure. Tip number one, and this is the most important: Never, ever share your password with anyone. Not your friends, not your family, not even someone claiming to be from Twitter. Your password is like the key to your house - you wouldn't give that to a stranger! Tip two: Use a strong password. Mix up letters, numbers, and symbols. Instead of 'password123,' try something like 'BlueCats2025!' - it's much harder for someone to guess. Tip three: If you're using a shared computer - like at a library or a friend's house - always remember to log out when you're finished. Tip four: Be very suspicious of emails asking for your Twitter password. Twitter will never, ever ask for your password by email. If you get an email like this, it's a scam - delete it immediately. And tip five: Trust your gut. If something feels suspicious or too good to be true, it probably is."</p>

                    <div style="background: #f9f9f9; padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--primary); margin: 1rem 0;">
                        <p>Dear [Interviewer Name / DofE Interview Panel],</p>

                        <p>I'm looking forward to delivering the training session on <strong>"Logging into Twitter for Complete Beginners"</strong> this Wednesday, 3rd December at 9:00 AM GMT via Microsoft Teams.</p>

                        <p><strong>What to Expect:</strong></p>
                        <p>In this 10-minute session, I'll guide you through:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What Twitter is and why logging in is important</li>
                            <li>A step-by-step demonstration of the login process</li>
                            <li>Common problems people face and how to solve them</li>
                            <li>Essential security tips for safe social media use</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>The session is designed for someone who has never used social media before, so I'll be using clear, jargon-free language throughout.</p>

                        <p><strong>Attached Resources:</strong></p>
                        <p>I've prepared a Quick Reference Guide (PDF) that you can use during and after the session. This includes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Visual step-by-step instructions</li>
                            <li>Solutions to common problems</li>
                            <li>Safety tips</li>
                            <li>Support contacts</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Feel free to review this in advance if you'd like, though it's not required.</p>

                        <p><strong>Optional - Follow Along:</strong></p>
                        <p>If you'd like to follow along practically during the session, you're welcome to have a device ready (phone, tablet, or computer). However, this is completely optional - the session will be just as valuable if you simply watch the demonstration.</p>

                        <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong></p>
                        <p>I'm committed to making this training accessible to everyone. If you need any specific adjustments to make the session work better for you (such as larger text, different color schemes, slower pace, or any other accommodation), please let me know and I'll be happy to arrange this.</p>

                        <p><strong>Questions Before the Session?</strong></p>
                        <p>If you have any questions before Wednesday, please feel free to reach out to me at williamjamesellis@outlook.com.</p>

                        <p><strong>Additional Resources:</strong></p>
                        <p>I've also created a web-based resource page with supplementary materials, which you can access here: https://wellis321.github.io/dofe/training-session.html</p>

                        <p>I'm really excited about this opportunity to demonstrate how I approach digital skills training, and I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday!</p>

                        <p>Best regards,</p>
