# Interview Prep Project Rules

1. **Purpose** – This repository should stay lightweight: a multi-page prep guide built with `index.html`, `organisation.html`, `questions.html`, and `prep.html` plus `styles.css` so you can easily host it on GitHub Pages. Update the pages with fresh notes after each new insight.

2. **Content updates** – Keep the organisation/role summaries aligned with the latest emails or research. When adding new interview answers or resources, place them on the relevant page (e.g., `organisation.html` for mission/role info, `questions.html` for prompts, `prep.html` for habits).

3. **Styling** – The stylesheet uses simple layout rules. Prefer semantic HTML (`section`, `details`, `ol`, etc.) and avoid large frameworks so deployment stays frictionless. Keep the nav structure consistent across all pages for a smooth experience.

4. **Deployment steps**:
   - Create a GitHub repo (if you haven’t already) and push these files to the `main` branch.
   - In repo settings, enable GitHub Pages from the `main`/`gh-pages` branch or `/docs` folder and set `index.html` as the entry point.
   - For quick previews, open the `index.html` file locally in your browser (no build step required).

5. **Next actions** – After interviews, add reflections to the prep plan section, update the FAQ with fresh questions, and keep this file updated with new rules or reminders.
