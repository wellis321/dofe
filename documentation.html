                <h2>Core Principles of Good Documentation</h2>
                <p>
                    Effective documentation serves as a bridge between complex information and users who need to
                    understand and apply it. Whether you're creating technical guides, user manuals, or knowledge
                    articles, these core principles apply.
                </p>
                <div class="list">
                    <strong>Key principles:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clarity</strong> — Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon unless necessary, and
                            always define technical terms when first introduced.</li>
                        <li><strong>Completeness</strong> — Provide all necessary information without assuming prior
                            knowledge. Include context, prerequisites, and expected outcomes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consistency</strong> — Use consistent terminology, formatting, and structure
                            throughout. This helps users build familiarity and find information quickly.</li>
                        <li><strong>User-focused</strong> — Write from the user's perspective. Consider their goals,
                            skill level, and what they need to accomplish.</li>
                        <li><strong>Actionable</strong> — Provide clear, step-by-step instructions that users can follow
                            to achieve their goals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Searchable</strong> — Structure content with clear headings, keywords, and metadata
                            so users can find what they need quickly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Maintainable</strong> — Design documentation that's easy to update as systems and
                            processes change.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p class="note">
                    For the DofE role, I understand that documentation will support staff using systems like eDofE,
                    Microsoft 365, and Dynamics. These principles ensure that documentation empowers staff to use these
                    systems confidently and independently.

                <p>
                    Well-organized documentation helps users navigate information efficiently and find what they need
                    quickly. A clear structure also makes documentation easier to maintain and update.

                    <strong>Document structure best practices:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Start with an overview</strong> — Begin with a brief summary of what the document
                            covers, who it's for, and what they'll learn or accomplish.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use a logical hierarchy</strong> — Organize content from general to specific, or
                            follow a workflow (setup → usage → troubleshooting).</li>
                        <li><strong>Create a table of contents</strong> — For longer documents, provide a clear TOC with
                            links to sections.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use descriptive headings</strong> — Headings should clearly indicate the content
                            beneath them. Use consistent heading levels (H1, H2, H3).</li>
                        <li><strong>Group related information</strong> — Keep related concepts together. Use sections and
                            subsections to break up content logically.</li>
                        <li><strong>Include navigation aids</strong> — Add "Next" and "Previous" links, breadcrumbs, or
                            a sidebar navigation for longer documents.</li>
                        <li><strong>End with next steps or references</strong> — Conclude with related resources, common
                            next steps, or links to related documentation.</li>

                <h2>Writing Style & Language</h2>
                <p>
                    The way you write documentation significantly impacts how easily users can understand and apply the
                    information. Clear, concise writing makes documentation more accessible and effective.
                </p>
                <div class="list">
                    <strong>Writing style guidelines:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Use active voice</strong> — "Click the Save button" is clearer than "The Save
                            button should be clicked."</li>
                        <li><strong>Be concise</strong> — Remove unnecessary words. "Click Save" is better than "You
                            should now click on the Save button."</li>
                        <li><strong>Use imperative mood for instructions</strong> — "Enter your username" rather than
                            "You enter your username" or "The username should be entered."</li>
                        <li><strong>Write in second person</strong> — Address the reader directly: "You can..." or
                            "Your account..."</li>
                        <li><strong>Define acronyms and technical terms</strong> — Spell out acronyms on first use
                            (e.g., "Learning Management System (LMS)"). Provide brief definitions for technical terms.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid ambiguous words</strong> — Use specific terms. "Click" is clearer than
                            "select" when referring to mouse actions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use consistent terminology</strong> — If you call it a "user account" in one place,
                            don't switch to "profile" elsewhere without reason.</li>
                        <li><strong>Break up long sentences</strong> — Aim for sentences under 20 words when possible.
                            Use lists for multiple related points.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="list">

                        <li><strong>Professional but friendly</strong> — Be approachable without being overly casual.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Confident and helpful</strong> — Write as if you're guiding a colleague, not lecturing
                            a student.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inclusive</strong> — Use gender-neutral language and avoid assumptions about the
                            user's background or experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Error-positive</strong> — Frame mistakes as learning opportunities. "If you see
                            this error..." rather than "Don't make this mistake..."</li>

                <p>
                    Technical documentation explains how systems, software, or processes work. It's used by developers,
                    system administrators, support staff, and end users. Good technical documentation balances depth with
                    accessibility.

                        <li><strong>Use semantic HTML</strong> — Proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3), lists, and
                            structure help screen readers navigate content.</li>
                        <li><strong>Provide alt text for images</strong> — Describe images in a way that conveys their
                            purpose and information to users who can't see them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ensure color contrast</strong> — Text should have sufficient contrast against
                            backgrounds (WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).</li>
                        <li><strong>Use descriptive link text</strong> — "Read the user guide" is better than "Click
                            here."</li>
                        <li><strong>Support keyboard navigation</strong> — Ensure all interactive elements are
                            keyboard accessible.</li>
                        <li><strong>Provide text alternatives</strong> — For video content, include transcripts or
                            captions. For audio, provide transcripts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use clear, readable fonts</strong> — Choose fonts that are easy to read at various
                            sizes. Avoid decorative fonts for body text.</li>
                        <li><strong>Structure content logically</strong> — Use headings, lists, and paragraphs to
                            create a clear information hierarchy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Test with assistive technologies</strong> — Verify documentation works with screen
                            readers, keyboard navigation, and other assistive tools.</li>
                    </ul>

                    For the DofE role, I understand that creating accessible documentation is essential, especially given
                            the role description mentions "accessibility tools to promote inclusivity." I would ensure
                            all documentation follows WCAG guidelines and is usable by staff with diverse needs and
                            abilities.

                <p>
                    Effective formatting and visual elements make documentation easier to scan, understand, and use.
                    Consistent formatting also helps users build familiarity with your documentation style.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Use whitespace effectively</strong> — Adequate spacing between sections, paragraphs,
                            and elements improves readability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Highlight important information</strong> — Use bold, italics, or callout boxes
                            sparingly to draw attention to key points, warnings, or tips.</li>
                        <li><strong>Create visual hierarchy</strong> — Use font sizes, weights, and colors to show
                            relationships between information.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use lists for multiple items</strong> — Bullet points for unordered items, numbered
                            lists for sequential steps.</li>
                        <li><strong>Include tables for structured data</strong> — Use tables for comparisons,
                            specifications, or reference information.</li>
                        <li><strong>Add code formatting</strong> — Use monospace fonts and syntax highlighting for code,
                            commands, file paths, and technical terms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use consistent styling</strong> — Apply the same formatting rules throughout your
