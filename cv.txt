Organisation Playbook 03/2025 - Present
The Organisation Playbook is a guide I'm creating to structuring an organisation around people and their
needs, rather than rigid systems. It aims to create intuitive, efficient workflows where staff do not require

natural and accessible.

Policy Management System 02/2025 - Present
I've created this resource to standardise organisational policy creation. Using this tool policies can have
strict version control with access limited to role permissions reflecting the organisational requirements.
Policies are easy to read and follow modern A11y principles and guidelines. They are easy to create, edit
and manage and integrate fully with the rest of the organisational digital architecture.

The Scotland Equality Group 01/1999 - Present
A group I founded to highlight the negative impact on all of us as a result of Income Inequality It provided
evidence on each of eleven different health and social problems: physical health, mental health, drug
abuse, education, imprisonment, obesity, social mobility, trust and community life, violence, teenage
births, and child well-being. For all eleven of these health and social problems, outcomes are very
substantially worse in more unequal societies.
